# Share My Day
4th Year honours project at the University of Dundee. The project is focused on developing a mobile application to give a child with complex communication needs a voice. It uses a combination of NFC sensors, voice recordings and pictures to be able to build up a story about a special moment during the day at school.

NOTE: This is still in development and will updated and refactored regularly
